gMaxLinkedï¼Œa framework or a backend application for large concurrency, real-time, long-live tcp applications. 

You can use gMaxLinked to establish application used by android push, WeChat/Line backend server, etc.  You can find the source code in src folder.

There are C and Java code for corresponding clients reference, you can find them in client folder.  You can use C client code directly, they have been tested with gMaxLinked as a server.  The java code can be used as reference only due to not be up to date. 

gMaxLinked only work on linux 64-bit(I compile and run the application on CentOS 7 64-bit and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit).
